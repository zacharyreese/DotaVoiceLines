# Ultimate Dota 2 Voice Lines List

This project is created to have a central source for all Dota 2 voice lines and their IDs. 

I feel limited by the 2 voice chat wheel lines that Valve supplies. I have many informative chats (Get Back, Group Up, Well Played, etc) to quickly communicate game decisions with my teammates, however, I also have many paid voice lines from TI that I would like to use for All Chat, but do not have enough slots on the 2 chat wheels. Therefore, I have bound voice lines to my num pad and arrow keys using console commands to have additional voice line slots.

The issue is that you need the ID of each voice line to bind it to a key, and Valve does not publicly make these IDs available. This project looks to solve that by creating a central repository for all Dota 2 voice lines.
